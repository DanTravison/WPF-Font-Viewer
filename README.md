# WPF-Font-Viewer
A simple WPF font visualizer

Font Viewer is a simple tool I created to help visualize text using 
various system font attributes, such as FontFamily, FontWeight, FontStyle and Size.

Additionally, it supports setting the TextDecoration and TextAlignment of the
containing control.

# Building the project
Open the FontViewer.sln solution file in Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022 and build the solution.

Note that the project targets .Net 6 but builds and runs without issue when targetting .Net 5.
